            I collaborate with the Royal Moroccan Cycling Federation and the Sidi Ali Unlock Pro 
            Cycling Team, capturing the speed, strategy, and spirit of cycling at major national and 
            international events. Beyond sports, I design and produce visual campaigns, brand identities, 
            and digital content that connect audiences with powerful stories.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, creativity is about more than visuals â€” it's about impact. Whether I'm designing a 
            graphic chart, shooting a race, or editing a video, I aim to create work that is bold, authentic, and

          <p>
            Professional photography forms the foundation of compelling visual narratives. I specialize 
            in sports photography, particularly cycling events, capturing dynamic action shots and 
            authentic moments that convey the intensity and emotion of competitive athletics.
          </p>
          <p>
            My photography work extends beyond sports to include commercial photography, portrait 
            work, and lifestyle documentation. I utilize advanced lighting techniques, composition 
            principles, and post-processing expertise to create images that serve both artistic and 
            commercial purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Technical proficiency with professional camera equipment, combined with an artistic eye 
            for composition and timing, enables me to deliver consistent, high-quality results across 
            diverse shooting scenarios and client requirements.
          </p>
          <h3>Videography</h3>

          />
          <p>
            Videography allows me to capture stories in motion, creating dynamic content that engages 
            audiences through compelling visual narratives. My work includes documentary-style coverage 
            of cycling events, commercial video production, and brand storytelling content.
          </p>
          <p>
            I employ professional cinematography techniques including strategic camera movement, 
            composition, and lighting control to create cinematic quality footage. This foundation 
            enables effective storytelling whether documenting sports events or creating branded content.
          </p>
          <p>
            From handheld action sequences to stable establishing shots, I adapt my approach to match 
            the content requirements while maintaining visual consistency and professional production values.

          <p>
            Post-production is where raw footage transforms into compelling stories. My video editing 
            expertise includes advanced timeline editing, color grading, audio mixing, and motion 
            graphics integration using industry-standard software like Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in creating dynamic montages that capture the energy and excitement of cycling 
            competitions, as well as polished commercial content that effectively communicates brand 
            messages. Strategic pacing, music selection, and visual effects enhance the emotional impact 
            of every project.
          </p>
          <p>
            My editing approach focuses on storytelling through rhythm, creating seamless narratives 
            that maintain viewer engagement while delivering key messages effectively and memorably.

          <p>
            Graphic design provides the visual foundation for brand communication across all media. 
            I create comprehensive visual identities, marketing materials, and digital content that 
            effectively communicate brand values while maintaining aesthetic excellence.
          </p>
          <p>
            My design work encompasses logo development, brand guidelines, promotional materials, and 
            digital graphics optimized for various platforms. I balance creative expression with 
            strategic communication objectives to ensure designs serve both artistic and commercial purposes.

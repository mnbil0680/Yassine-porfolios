Radio Azawan represents a comprehensive brand identity project for a contemporary radio station. This project involved creating a distinctive visual identity that captures the essence of modern broadcasting while maintaining cultural authenticity.

The design approach focused on creating a versatile brand system that works across various media platforms and applications. _Key design objectives:_

- **Create a memorable visual identity**. The logo design needed to be instantly recognizable and work effectively across different scales, from social media avatars to billboard advertisements. The typography and color palette were carefully selected to convey energy, modernity, and trustworthiness.
- **Develop flexible brand applications**. The brand identity system includes various applications such as station IDs, promotional materials, digital assets, and merchandise designs. Each application maintains brand consistency while adapting to specific use cases.
- **Establish strong market presence**. The visual identity aims to differentiate Radio Azawan in a competitive broadcasting landscape, creating a strong emotional connection with the target audience through compelling design elements.

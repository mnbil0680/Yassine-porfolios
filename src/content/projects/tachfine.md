I created a comprehensive visual identity system for Tachfine Center, an educational and cultural organization. This project involved designing various promotional materials including event posters, social media content, and branding elements. The designs feature vibrant colors and modern typography to appeal to their target audience while maintaining professional standards for the organization's communications.

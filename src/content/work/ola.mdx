## Overview

I provided comprehensive creative services for **OLA Car Oil Services**, a leading automotive maintenance company specializing in premium car oil products and services. Over an 8-month collaboration, I delivered a complete visual identity transformation covering three key creative disciplines: photography and color editing, videography and montage, and graphic design.

OLA needed a cohesive visual presence that would communicate their expertise in automotive care while appealing to both professional mechanics and car owners. The challenge was creating content that could work across multiple platforms - from social media campaigns to service center displays - while maintaining brand consistency across all touchpoints.

My role encompassed the full creative pipeline: concept development, content creation, post-production, and brand implementation. This integrated approach ensured that every visual element, from product photography to promotional videos, reinforced OLA's positioning as a premium automotive service provider.

## Photography & Color Editing

### Product Photography Excellence

Professional automotive photography requires understanding both technical precision and brand storytelling. I developed a comprehensive photography system for OLA's extensive product line, focusing on creating images that communicate quality and reliability.

The video content successfully communicated OLA's technical expertise while making automotive maintenance feel accessible and trustworthy for customers.

## Graphic Design & Brand Identity

## Project Overview

The Sidi Ali Tour is a vibrant and high-energy cycling race held in the seaside district of Aïn Diab, Casablanca, and sponsored by the Moroccan water-brand Sidi Ali. The event assembles professional, semi-professional, and passionate amateur cyclists, transforming the streets of Casablanca into a competitive racecourse. Riders navigate a route that combines coastal roads, urban turns, and moments of high speed, all against the backdrop of the Atlantic surf and city skyline. The Tour is more than a race — it’s a spectacle of athleticism, community, and brand engagement: grandstands gather spectators lining the route, media and sponsors amplify the excitement, and the course becomes a stage for the country’s rising and established talents to compete. Each edition of the Sidi Ali Tour aims to shine a light on cycling culture in Morocco, promote the sport’s growth, and deliver a memorable day of competition in one of Casablanca’s most iconic neighborhoods.

## Creative Process & Methodology

### Photography & Visual Storytelling

I conducted extensive photography sessions to capture the authentic spirit of Moroccan tourism experiences. The photography work focused on creating compelling visual narratives that would inspire travelers and showcase the unique experiences SIDI Tour offers.

**Key Photography Elements:**

- **Cultural Heritage Documentation**: Captured traditional architecture, craftsmanship, and local customs
- **Experience Photography**: Documented authentic tourist experiences and memorable moments
- **Landscape & Destination Shots**: Showcased Morocco's diverse geographical beauty
- **People & Hospitality**: Captured genuine interactions and Moroccan hospitality

### Advanced Color Editing & Enhancement

The color editing process was crucial in establishing SIDI Tour's distinctive visual style. I developed a color palette that reflected Morocco's vibrant culture while ensuring consistency across all brand applications.

**Color Editing Approach:**

- **Warm Earth Tones**: Enhanced natural Moroccan colors - terracotta, ochre, and desert hues
- **Cultural Color Harmony**: Balanced traditional Moroccan colors with modern design sensibilities
- **Mood Enhancement**: Applied color grading to evoke feelings of adventure and cultural discovery
- **Brand Consistency**: Established a signature color treatment recognizable across all materials

### Visual Identity Design

The visual identity system needed to work across diverse applications - from digital platforms to traditional print materials. I created a comprehensive identity that honored Moroccan design traditions while meeting contemporary branding standards.

**Identity Components:**

- **Logo Development**: Created a distinctive mark that balanced cultural authenticity with modern appeal
- **Typography System**: Selected fonts that complemented Arabic and Latin text requirements
- **Pattern & Motif Integration**: Incorporated traditional Moroccan geometric patterns and cultural elements
- **Application Guidelines**: Developed usage standards for consistent brand implementation

### Graphic Design Applications

The graphic design work encompassed various touchpoints that tourists would encounter throughout their journey with SIDI Tour. Each design element reinforced the brand identity while serving specific functional purposes.

**Design Applications:**

- **Marketing Collateral**: Brochures, flyers, and promotional materials for international distribution
- **Digital Presence**: Social media templates, website graphics, and online advertising materials
- **Wayfinding & Signage**: Clear, culturally appropriate signage for tour locations and facilities
- **Merchandise Design**: Branded items that serve as memorable souvenirs for tourists
